# DATT1000-MidTerm_Assignment
An MaxMSP patch that I created for a DATT 1000 midterm assignment. It is an music audio visualizer (creates cool effects on sync with the music's beats).

Some of code was learned from online resourses like youtube or the MaxMSP forum. But as of now, some of them were no longer available to be accessed or is now harder to find. 
So this repo will help provide the code for you to learn.
